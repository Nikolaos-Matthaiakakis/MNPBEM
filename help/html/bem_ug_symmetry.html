%% Mirror symmetry
%
% Sometimes a problem under investigation exhibits mirror symmetry, i.e.
% the particle can be flipped at the x- or y-axis or both and becomes
% transformed into itself, and also the excitation preserves the symmetry.
% This is the case for plane wave excitation from above or below with
% normal incidence, or for arbitrary dipole orientations.  In these cases
% BEM simulations exploiting mirror symmetry can be performed.  The
% simulations can be significantly faster and use less memory, which might
% be beneficial for large or complex nanoparticles.  On the other hand, BEM
% simulations with mirror symmetry are more complicated to set up and one
% should use them only if absolutely necessary.  
%
% In future releases we will not give strong precedence to the development
% of mirror symmetry.
%
%% Initialization

%  indicate mirror symmetry in the option structure
op = bemoptions( op, 'sym', sym );
%  set up COMPARTICLEMIRROR object with mirror symmetry
p = comparticlemirror( epstab, ptab, inout, closed, op, PropertyName, PropertyValue );

%%
% In the option structure the keyword 
%
% * *|sym='x'|* indicates that the particle can be flipped at the x-axis
% only,
% * *|sym='y'|* indicates that the particle can be flipped at the y-axis
% only, and
% * *|sym='xy'|* indicates that the particle can be flipped at both the x-
% and y-axis
%
% without changing shape.  The parameters in the
% <matlab:doc('comparticlemirror') comparticlemirror> call are the same as
% those used for a <bem_ug_comparticle.html comparticle> initialization
%
% * *|epstab={eps1,eps2,...}|* a table of dielectric functions,
% * *|ptab={p1,p2,...}|* a table of discretized particle surfaces,
% * *|inout=[in1,out1;in2,out2]|* an index array for the dielectric medium
% in- and out-side the particle surfaces (defined with respect to the
% outer surface normals), 
% * *|closed|* additional information whether the particle boundaries
% are open or closed surfaces, and
% * *|op|* an option array that controls whether the particles boundaries
% are flat or curved and that defines the <bem_ug_integration.html particle
% integration>.
%
%% Particle boundaries
%
% In the |comparticlemirror| initialization the boundaries must only be one
% half or quarter of the total boundary.  The remainder of the particle
% boundary is obtained by applying symmetry operations.
%
% <<../figures/comparticlemirror.jpg>>
%
% In the above examples, the sphere and the coupled triangles exhibit
% xy-symmetry wheras the single triangle exhibits x-symmetry.  The MNPBEM
% toolbox provides a number of means to create particle boundaries with
% mirror symmetry.
%
% First, one can create a particle and then <matlab:doc('particle/select')
% select> only part of it.  For spheres one can use the |trispheresegment|
% function

p = trispheresegment( linspace( 0, pi / 2, 10 ), linspace( 0, pi, 20 ), diameter );

%% 
% For particles created through extrusion of <bem_ug_ploygon3d.html
% polygons> one can provide in the extrusion functions a symmetry keyword

p = tripolygon( poly, edge, op, 'sym', 'xy' );

%%
% that will automatically produce a boundary with the requested symmetry.
% Also the |polygon3| class is written such that all methods can be used
% together with the |sym| keyword.  In the above figure, the particles |p|
% of the |comparticlemirror| class are those indicated by the wire frames.
% The full particles, which are obtained through symmetry operations, can
% be obtained through

%  full particle surface (COMPARTICLE object)
pfull = full( p );

%% BEM simulations
%
% BEM simulations without and with mirror symmetry are very similar within
% the MNPBEM toolbox.  They have been implemented for both quasistatic and
% retarded simulations, and for plane wave and dipole excitations.  EELS
% simulations and layer structures are not implemented with mirror
% symmetry. 

%  set up BEM solver
bem = bemsolver( p, op );
%  set up plane wave excitation and dipole excitation
exc = planewave( pol, dir, op );
dip = dipole( pt, op );
%  compute surface charges
sig1 = bem \ exc( p, enei );
sig2 = bem \ dip( p, enei );
%  compute scattering and extinction cross section
sca = exc.sca( sig1 );
ext = exc.ext( sig1 );
%  compute total and radiative scattering rate
[ tot, rad ] = dip.decayrate( sig2 );

%%
% If one wants to obtain the surface charges for the full particle or the
% electromagnetic fields or potentials at the particle boundary, one should
% call

%  get surface charge distribution of full particle
sigfull = full( sig );
%  get electromagnetic fields and potentials of full particle
f   = full(     field( bem, sig ) );
pot = full( potential( bem, sig ) );

%% Tips and tricks
%
% The philosophy behind simulations with mirror symmetry is
%
% * to perform the BEM simulations using mirror symmetry and
% * to use the surface charges |sig| for the calculation of scattering
% cross sections, decay rates, or the electromagnetic fields and potentials
% at the particle boundaries.
% * For any other type of post-processing, one should expand the
% |compstructmirror| objects _immediately_ after the BEM solver calls to
% full size using the |full()| command.
%
%% Working principle
%
% The BEM solvers exploiting mirror symmetry require external excitations
% with well-defined parities.  Examples are light polarizations along x and
% y, or the combination of dipoles depicted in the figure below. If
% interested in other light polarizations, one can take the fundamental
% solutions for x- and y-polarization and form a linear superposition.  In
% a similar fashion, one can exploit the linearity of Maxwell's equations
% and add the different dipole orientations to obtain the configuration
% where a single dipole is located in the first quadrant.
%
% <<../figures/mirrordipole.jpg>>
%
% The excitation classes with mirror symmetry work such that they
%
% * first store the requested light polarizations or dipole orientations,
% * perform BEM simulations with the solvers including mirror symmetry for
% the excitations with well-defined parities (i.e. light-polarizations
% along x or y, or dipole configurations depicted in the above figure), and
% * finally form a linear superposition of these BEM simulations to obtain
% the results for the requested input.
%
% Because of this procedure, it is important that the surface charges (as
% well as fields or potentials computed at the particle boundary) are
% expanded to full size at the end of the simulation.
%
%% Examples
%
% A number of examples for BEM simulations with mirror symmetry can be
% found in the <bem_example.html demo files> section.
