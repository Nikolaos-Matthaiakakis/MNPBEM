%% Overview of the MNPBEM Toolbox
%
% In the following we briefly discuss the purpose as well as the
% implemented features of the toolbox.
%
%% Short overview
%
% * *Purpose.*  The main purpose of the toolbox is to provide a flexible
% simulation toolkit for the calculation of the electromagnetic properties
% of plasmonic nanoparticles.  In principle, the toolbox works for
% arbitrary dielectric bodies with homogeneous dielectric properties, which
% are separated by abrupt interfaces.  We have primarily used and tested
% the toolbox for metallic nanoparticles with diameters ranging from a few
% to a few hundred nanometers, and for frequencies in the optical and
% near-infrared regime.
% * *Implementation.*  The toolbox has been implemented with Matlab
% classes. These classes can be easily combined, which has the advantage
% that one can adapt the simulation programs flexibly to the user's needs.
% Our approach requires from the user some basic understanding of the
% working principle of the MNPBEM toolbox. This is what will be given in
% the user guide.
% * *Simulation scheme.*  The toolbox provides a number of routines for
% discretizing the boundaries of the dielectric particles, as will be
% discussed below.  Once one has specified the dielectric properties of the
% particles, together with a few additional informations, one can solve
% Maxwell's equations using a _boundary element method_ (BEM) approach.
% Different solution schemes exist based on either the quasistatic
% approximation or the full Maxwell equations. 
% * *Examples.* A number of demo programs are collected in the
% <bem_example.html example> section.
%
%% Features of the toolbox
% 
% * *Plane wave excitation.*  We have implemented plane wave excitation
% of dielectric nanoparticles, together with the calculation of the
% corresponding scattering and extinction cross sections.
% * *Dipole excitation.*  We also provide excitation of oscillating
% dipoles, together with a calculation of the resulting total and radiative
% scattering rates for the dipole. With such excitations, it is also
% possible to compute the photonic local density of states (LDOS) and
% dyadic Green functions.
% * *Layer structure.* Plane wave and dipole excitations have been 
% implemented for layer structures and substrates.  
% * *EELS simulation.*  We additionally provide classes for the simulation
% of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and cathodoluminescence of
% plasmonic nanoparticles.
% * *Iterative solvers and H-matrices.*  The latest version of the toolbox
% now also includes iterative solvers and H-matrices for the simulation of
% large nanoparticles (consisting of a few 10 000 boundary elements).
% * *Nonlocality* We provide a simple model accounting for nonlocal
% dielectric functions.  Following the approach of Pendry and coworkers,
% nonlocality within the hydrodynamic model is modeled throgh a thin,
% artificial cover layer with local dielectric properties.

%
% Details about our MNPBEM toolbox have been published in
%
% * U. Hohenester and A. Trügler, Comp. Phys. Commun. *183*, 370 (2012).
% * U. Hohenester, Comp. Phys. Commun. *185*, 1177 (2014).
% * J. Waxenegger, A. Trügler, and U. Hohenester, Comp. Phys. Commun.
% *193*, 138 (2015).
%
% In the last couple of years the toolbox has been extensively used by us
% and other groups for the simulation of plasmonic nanoparticles.  The 2012
% paper has currently been cited about 140 times and the latest version of
% the toolbox has been downloaded from our
% <http://physik.uni-graz.at/mnpbem MNPBEM> website more than 1000 times.
%
%% Toolbox history
%
% * *MNPBEM11* was the first release, which was described in U. Hohenester
% and A. Trügler, Comp. Phys. Commun. *183*, 370 (2012).
% * *MNPBEM13* was the second release, which was described in U.
% Hohenester, Comp. Phys. Commun. *185*, 1177 (2014).  In comparison to
% MNPBEM11 this second release includes EELS excitations and mirror
% symmetry, and corrects a number of small errors and inconsistencies.
% * *MNPBEM14* was the third release, which was described in J. Waxenegger
% et al., Comp. Phys. Commun. *193*, 138 (2015).  It introduced simulations
% of nanoparticles situated in stratified media, as well as a more flexible
% user interface (one common options structure, improved Green function
% evaluation, improved plot functionality, etc.).
% * *MNPBEM17* is the latest release which introduces hierarchical matrices
% (in short H-matrices) and iterative solvers for the simulation of larger
% nanoparticles consisting of a few 1000 to several 10000 boundary
% elements.  We also introduce a simple simulation approach for nonlocal
% dielectric functions, following a proposal of Pendry and coworkers.
