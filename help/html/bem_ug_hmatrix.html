%% Hierarchical matrices
%
% Hierarchical matrices, or H-matrices in short, allow for a compression of
% the Green function matrices, as well as for fast and low-memory matrix
% manipulations.  Our H-matrix compression scheme follows Boerm et al.,
% Engineering Analysis with Boundary Element *27*, 405 (2003).  In general
% the H-matrices remain hidden within the iterative BEM solver classes.

%% Working principle
%
% H-matrices build on the <bem_ug_clustertree.html cluster tree> class. The
% basic idea behind the approach is that for clusters sufficiently far
% apart one doesn't have to compute all Green function elements but can
% submit the sub-matrices to some sort of compression.  The approach is
% inspired by the multipole expansion, where cluster interactions are
% approximated through a truncated series of multipole interactions.  In
% our H-matrix implementation, however, we use a compression scheme where
% the sub-matrices are approximated through low-rank matrices.  The
% advantages of this approach are that it works automatically, and thus can
% be also employed for layer structure interactions, and that several
% matrix manipulations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or
% inversion can be approximately performed with H-matrices.
% 
% To determine whether a sub-matrix can be submitted to a low-rank
% approximation, one must provide a function such as

%  function for admissibility
fadmiss = @( rad1, rad2, dist ) 2.5 * min( rad1, rad2 ) < dist;

%%
% This function, which in the above form is returned by |bemiter.options|,
% must be added to the option structure passed to the BEM solvers.  The
% function takes three arguments, namely the radii |rad1| and |rad2| of the
% clusters' bounding boxes, and the distance |dist| between the clusters,
% and returns true if the two clusters can be submitted to a low-rank
% approximation (using the adaptive cross approximation, ACA) and false
% otherwise.
%
% The other option arguments passed to the <bem_ug_bemiter.html iterative
% BEM solvers>, which control the H-matrix performance, are as follows:
%
% * *|htol|* is the tolerance for the H-matrix compression with the default
% setting |htol=1e-6|.  It controls the accuracy of the low-rank
% approximation and should be set to a value between |1e-4| and |1e-8|.
% * *|kmax|* is the maximum rank for H-matrix compression with the default
% seeting |kmax=[4,100]|.  The larger value controls the maximum rank for
% the low-rank approximation of the Green functions, and should be chosen
% sufficiently large.  The smaller value determines the maximum rank for
% H-matrix manipulations. In our approach we use H-matrix manipulations
% only for the approximate solution of the BEM equations, which serve as a
% _preconditioner_ for the iterative BEM solver.  Thus, the larger value of
% |kmax| controls the overall accuracy of the H-matrix compression (and
% should be chosen sufficiently large), whereas the smaller value only
% influences the performance of the preconditioner (and should be chosen
% rather small to obtain a significant speedup of the H-matrix
% manipulations).
%
%% Examples
%
% Consider the BEM solver for a gold nanorod

%  options for BEM simulation
op = bemoptions( 'sim', 'ret', 'iter', bemiter.options );
%  table of dielectric functions
epstab = { epsconst( 1 ), epstable( 'gold.dat' ) };
%  initialize nanorod
p = trirod( 20, 800, [ 15, 15, 500 ] );
p = comparticle( epstab, { p }, [ 2, 1 ], 1, op );
%  set up BEM solver and perform initialization
bem = bemsolver( p, op );
bem = bem( 800 );
