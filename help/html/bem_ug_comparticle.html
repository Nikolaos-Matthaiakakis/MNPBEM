##### SOURCE BEGIN #####
%% The comparticle class
%
% The class |comparticle| stores composite particles, consisting of sharp
% boundaries that separate regions filled with different dielectric media,
% together with the information how these particles are embedded in the
% dielectric environment.
%
%% Initialization

%  initialize COMPARTICLE object with closed argument
p = comparticle( epstab, ptab, inout, closed, op );
%  pass additional arguments
p = comparticle( epstab, ptab, inout, closed, op, PropertyName, PropertyValue );
%  initialize COMPARTICLE object without closed argument
p = comparticle( epstab, ptab, inout, op );

%%
% In the initialization, one has to provide
%
% * *|epstab={eps1,eps2,...}|* a table of dielectric functions,
% * *|ptab={p1,p2,...}|* a table of discretized particle surfaces,
% * *|inout=[in1,out1;in2,out2}|* an index array for the dielectric medium
% in- and out-side the particle surfaces (defined with respect to the
% outer surface normals), 
% * *|closed|* additional information whether the particle boundaries
% are open or closed surfaces, and
% * *|op|* an option array that controls whether the particles boundaries
% are flat or curved and that defines the <bem_ug_integration.html particle
% integration>.
%
% |epstab| is a cell array of all dielectric functions under use.  It is
% fine if |epstab| contains unused materials.  |ptab| is a cell array of
% all particle boundaries separating media with different dielectric
% materials.  |inout| is a |nx2| array of same size |n| as the number of
% particles.  |epstab{inout(i,1)}| gives for the i'th particle the
% dielectric material at the inside and |epstab{inout(i,2)}| the material
% at the outside.  In- and outside are defined with respect to the outer
% surface normal, which can be investigated through

%  plot particle boundaries and outer surface normals
plot( p, 'EdgeColor', 'b', 'nvec', 1 );

%%
% It is important that the materials are assigned to the proper boundary
% side, otherwise the BEM solvers will give completely wrong results.
% Finally, the |closed| arguments indicate closed particle boundaries.
%
%% Closed particle boundaries
%
% For closed surfaces the surface derivative of the Green function $F$
% fulfills the sum rule (see e.g. R. Fuchs and S. H. Liu, Phys. Rev. B
% *14*, 5521 (1976))
%
% $$ \oint_{\partial V} F({\bf s},{\bf s}')\,da'=2\pi\,, $$
%
% where the integration extends over a closed surface boundary $\partial V$
% with _outer_ surface normals.  Upon discretizing the integral within a
% boundary element method approach, the expression translates to the fact
% that |sum(F,2)| should give |2*pi|.  In the MNPBEM program this is used
% to calculate the diagonal elements of |F|, which play an important role
% in particular for flat particle boundaries.
%
% In the MNPBEM toolbox one can provide the |closed| argument in the
% initialization of a |comparticle| object |p|.  

%  indicate that P1 is a closed boundary
p = comparticle( epstab, { p1 }, inout, 1, op );
%  indicate that P1 and P2 are separately closed boundaries
p = comparticle( epstab, { p1, p2 }, inout, 1, 2, op );
%  indicate that P1 and P2 together form one closed boundary
p = comparticle( epstab, { p1, p2 }, inout, [ 1, 2 ], op );

%%
% Alternatively, one can later call

%  boundary 1 is a closed surface
p = closed( p, 1 ); 
%  boundaries 1 and 2 form a closed surface
p = closed( p, [ 1,  2 ] );    
%  boundaries 1 and 2 form a closed surface, and we change the orientation
%  of boundary 2 such that the normal surface vectors become reversed
p = closed( p, [ 1, -2 ] );
%  boundary 1 together with boundary P2 form a closed surface
p = closed( p, { 1, p2 } );     
                                
%%
% The above examples show different calling sequences.  In the second line
% we indicate that particles 1 and 2 of the |comparticle| object |p| form a
% closed surface.  In the last line we indicate that particle 1 together
% with an additional user-supplied particle |p2| form a closed surface.
%
% When a particle surface appears in several of the closed particle
% surfaces, there is a first-come, first-served principle.  This means that
% the first appearence of a particle surface in one of the |closed|
% argument determines the closed surface that is chosen for the particle,
% e.g. through |[1,2],[-1,3]| we assign the surface |[1,2]| to particle 1.
%
%% Methods
%
% The |comparticle| class has several methods inherited from the particle
% class.

%  shift COMPARTICLE by vector [ x, y, z ]
p = shift( p, [ x, y, z ] );    
%  rotate COMPARTICLE around given axis DIR (z on default) by angle PHI (degrees)
p = rot( p, angle, dir );
%  flip COMPARTICLE at axis AX, eg. ax = 1 for x-axis
p = flip( p, ax );               
%  scale COMPARTICLE by factor S
p = scale( p, s );    
%  change face directions
p = flipfaces( p );
%  select specific boundary elements
%    - either by providing a function in Cartesian, polar, or spherical coordinates, 
%    - or by providing an index
p = select( p, 'carfun', @(   x, y, z ) fun( x,   y, z ) );
p = select( p, 'polfun', @( phi, r, z ) fun( phi, r, z ) );

% Additional methods can be inspected through the
% <matlab:doc('comparticle') doc> command.
%
%% Tips and tricks
%
% Setting up |comparticle| objects calls for an alert user since several
% things can go wrong.  A few common mistakes, which occasionally even
% happen to us as experienced developers of our own toolbox, are
%
% * The outer surface normals point into the wrong direction.  If this is
% the case, the in- and outside media are different from what one expects.
% Usually this does not lead to a runtime error, but in results that look
% unexpected such as broad scattering spectra with no pronounced plasmon
% peaks.  We recommend to regularly check the orientation of the surface
% normals by plotting them through
% <matlab:plot(trisphere(144),'EdgeColor','b','nvec',1)
% plot(p,'EdgeColor','b','nvec',1)>.
% * The closed argument is not set properly.  This will not lead to a
% runtime error but to wrong results.  If one is not sure about the closed
% argument, one can set in the <bem_ug_options.html options> structure the
% boundary interpolation to |'interp'='curv'| and run the simulation with
% and without the |closed| arguments.  If things are implemented properly,
% the results should not differ significantly.  We recommend to use the
% |closed| argument for both flat and curved boundary elements.
% * In |epstab| the first entry should be the dielectric function of the
% embedding medium.  For <bem_ug_layerstructure.html layer structures> the
% first entry should be the uppermost medium of the layer structure.
% * When different particles are composed of the same material, we
% recommend to use different entries in the |epstab| cell array, as
% discussed below in the examples.
%
%% Examples
%
% <<../figures/compsphere.jpg>>
%
% *Single sphere.*  We first show how to set up the |comparticle| object
% for a single sphere that is embedded in a homogeneous dielectric
% background. To define this dielectric environment, we set

%  table of dielectric functions
epstab = { epsconst( 1.33 ^ 2 ), epstable( 'gold.dat' ) };
%  sphere boundary (diameter of 10 nm)
p = trisphere( 144, 10 );
%  compound of particles in dielectric environment
p = comparticle( epstab, { p }, [ 2, 1 ], 1, op );

%%
% First, we define a table (cell array) of all dielectric functions that
% are needed to describe the dielectric environment of the particle.  In
% our example it consists of the dielectric constant for water and a
% dielectric function representative for gold.  We recommend to set the
% first entry in the dielectric table to the embedding medium as several
% routines (e.g. for the calculation of scattering spectra) assume this on
% default.
%
% We next set up a table (cell array) of particle boundaries.  In case of
% the single sphere it consists of a single particle.  The particles and
% dielectric functions are related through the |inout| array, which is
% passed as the third paramater to |comparticle|.  In the above example it
% is a vector |inout=[2,1]| where the first entry corresponds to the medium
% inside the particle (defined through the direction of the surface normal)
% and the second entry to the material outside the particle.  The last
% parameter in the |comparticle| initialization indicates that the particle
% bounday is closed.
%
% *Coupled spheres.*  Let us next look to the example of two coupled

% The dielectric table now consists of three entries.  Note that we add the
% gold dielectric function twice to discriminate between the dielectric
% media of the left and right sphere.  We recommend to use different
% entries in the dielectric table for dielectric media that are separated,
% although in principle one could also use a single dielectric function
% instead.  In the call to |comparticle| we then define that with
%
% * |inout=[ _2,1_ ; 3,1]| the medium in- and out-side the _first particle_
% is described by the dielectric functions |epstab{2}| and |epstab{1}|,
% *  |inout=[2,1; _3,1_ ]| the medium in- and out-side the _second
% particle_ is described by the dielectric functions |epstab{3}| and
% |epstab{1}|.
%
% The last two |1,2| arguments in the |comparticle| initialization indicate
% that both particle surfaces are closed.
%
% *Dumbell nanoparticle.*  We finally discuss the more complicated example
% of a dumbell structure consisting of two metallic spheres separated by a
% semiconductor middle part.
%
% <<../figures/compdumbell.jpg>>
%
% Note that we have divided the spheres into two boundaries: one with the
% exterior region described by the background dielectric, and another one
% with the exterior region of the semiconductor middle part.  To set up the
% dielectric environment we call

%  table of dielectric functions
epstab = { epsconst( 1.33 ^ 2 ), epstable( 'gold.dat' ),  ...
           epsconst( 10       ), epstable( 'gold.dat' ) };
%  compound of particles in dielectric environment
p = comparticle( epstab, { p1, p2, p3, p4, p5 },  ...
  [ 2, 1; 2, 3; 3, 1; 4, 3; 4, 1 ], [ 1, 2 ], [ 4, 5 ], [ 3, -2, -4 ], op );

% One should check carefully how the |inout| argument connects the
% different dielectric regions.  In the |closed| argument we indicate that
% the boundaries 1 and 2 (red and green) form a single closed surface.  The
% same applies to the boundaries 4 and 5, as well as boundary 3 together
% with boundaries 2, 4 (flipped faces).
